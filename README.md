This project is a single static `index.html` file with no build steps required. You can clone it, configure it, and run it immediately.

### Setup & Configuration

To get your own version of Moen up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Set up Firebase:**

      * Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
      * In the project, create a **Firestore Database**. When prompted for security rules, choose **Start in test mode** for easy setup.
      * Add a new **Web App** to your Firebase project. Firebase will provide you with a configuration object that contains your API keys. Copy this object.

2.  **Add Your Firebase Keys:**

      * Open the `index.html` file.
      * Find the `<script>` tag at the bottom of the file.
      * Locate the `firebaseConfig` object and **replace the placeholder values with the configuration object you copied from your Firebase project.**

    <!-- end list -->

    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = { 
        /* PASTE YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG OBJECT HERE */ 
    };
    ```

3.  **Customize Academic Events:**

      * In the same `<script>` tag, find the `academicEvents` array.
      * You can **change, add, or remove events** in this JSON array to match your own university's or school's calendar.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```javascript
    const academicEvents = [ 
        { title: "Midterm Exams Begin", date: "2025-10-20" }, 
        { title: "Project Alpha Due", date: "2025-11-05" }, 
        // ... add your own events here
    ];
    ```

4.  **Run the App:**

      * Save the `index.html` file and open it directly in your web browser. It's now fully functional and connected to your personal Firebase backend\!
